# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

# Ans: because we can't start giving variable an integer name. if we, we should begin with, a string-like alphabet name then integer. e100 or eggs100 is valid

# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

# ans: str(), int(), float()

# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

# 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'

# sol:  because 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings, if we have to concatenate it we need to do typecasting.
